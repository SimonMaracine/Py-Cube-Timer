        <p class="about">Py-Cube-Timer is a tool for timing your solves. If you worked with other timers before, then you'll have no problem using this.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>To use this timer, you'll need to have a session created and selected. If you see nothing in the top left corner, then there is no session selected. Go ahead and create a new session, if you don't have one, by clicking <span class="b">File > New Session</span> and entering a name.</p>
            <p>To the left you have the session name, the current and best time, ao5 and ao12, the average of the entire session and a list with the solves.</p>
            <p>To start the timer, press spacebar. If inspection is enabled, you have to press spacebar one more time. And to stop the timer, press any key.</p>
            <p>After the timer stopped, the solve time, date and scramble are saved into the session file.</p>
            <p>You can click on a solve (on the actual time) to see it's date and scramble and to delete it, if you want to.</p>
            <p>You can also remove the last solve by clicking <span class="b">Edit > Remove Last Solve</span>, or by pressing Alt + Z.</p>
            <p>If you don't like the current name of your session, you can change it by clicking <span class="b">Edit > Rename This Session</span>. And if you don't like how you performed at all, you can delete this session forever.</p>
            <p>Sessions can only live in the data/sessions folder. To switch between sessions, click <span class="b">File > Open Session</span> and type the name, or click Open file and select it from there.</p>
            <p>If you want to know how you performed in your session so far, you can click <span class="b">File > See Statistics</span> to see a graph of your times. It's cool!</p>
            <p>There are some settings you can change. Click <span class="b">Edit > Settings</span>. There you can change the timer and the scramble size, enable/disable inspection, change colors and enable/disable backups.</p>
            <p>To backup your session, you have to specify a path to a writable folder you want to backup to. Every five solves, only your entire *current* session will be backed up. You can also backup manually by clicking <span class="b">File > Backup Session Now</span>.</p>
            <p>If you have a backup file of a session and you want to use it, you'll have to rename it to the session name and put it in the data/sessions folder. For example, if you have the backup file <span class="file">backup_2020-10_MySession</span>, then you'll rename it to <span class="file">MySession</span>.</p>
            <p>That's all, folks.</p>

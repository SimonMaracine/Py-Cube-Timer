# Py-Cube-Timer
Py-Cube-Timer is a tool for timing your Rubik's Cube solves. It has the following features:
- Solves are grouped into sessions, which can be saved and loaded at any time
- Sessions can be backed up into a safe folder of your choice on your system
- Supports WCA inspection
- Has a WCA-like 3x3x3 scramble generator
- Has an old, but nice UI
- The background and foreground colors of the UI are of your choice
- Shows the current and best time, ao5 and ao12 and shows the mean of the session
- Shows a graph of your session
- And most importantly - it's written in Python :)

If you don't like it, then just use [csTimer](https://cstimer.net/). What can I say?
